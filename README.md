# DeFi yield farming project

## Introduction
Yield farming, also known as liquidity mining, is a strategy that involves providing liquidity to decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols in exchange for rewards in the form of cryptocurrency. These rewards are often distributed in the form of newly minted tokens that are specific to the DeFi protocol being used. The concept of yield farming originated on the Ethereum blockchain and has since gained popularity as a way for cryptocurrency holders to earn passive income. To participate in yield farming, an individual must first provide liquidity to a DeFi protocol by depositing their cryptocurrency into a liquidity pool. This pool is then used to facilitate trades between different types of cryptocurrency, and the individuals who have provided liquidity to the pool are rewarded with a share of the fees generated by these trades. Yield farming has gained popularity due to the high returns that it can offer. However, it is important to note that yield farming is not without risk. DeFi protocols are still a relatively new and rapidly evolving area, and there have been instances where yield farming opportunities have turned out to be scams or have failed due to technical issues. Additionally, the value of the rewards received through yield farming is highly dependent on the performance of the cryptocurrency market, which can be volatile.


Program uses USDT, or Tether, which is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of a specific asset or currency, such as the US dollar. This means that the value of 1 USDT is intended to always be equal to $1.00. One of the main benefits of USDT is that it allows individuals to hold and transfer value without being exposed to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market. This can be particularly useful for individuals who want to use cryptocurrency for transactions but do not want to take on the risk of price fluctuations. Using the Application When entered users are welcomed by the simplistic interface that allows them to see their current staked amount, their reward balance and available tokens for releasing. Users can interact with two text-boxes. With those they can change the amount they would like to deposit and the time they would like to put the money in for. Putting the money into the bank for longer amounts of time gives much higher yields. There are two buttons, one allowing users to deposit their money while the later one allows them to withdraw their money. Users can only withdraw the money they have after the indicated time period they chose while depositing. A countdown clock on the bottom shows the time left before the next airdrop. At the time of airdrop the application asks the user to accept the tokens using their wallet application.


## Implementation
Project is created as a single instance application with no separation between backend and front-end. Front-end and application logic is written in javascript using React.js while the contracts are written in solidity. Application includes 4 contracts to be migrated to the blockchain. Important ones are listed below. Decentral Bank Decentral bank handles all the staking, withdrawal and token release operations. Decentral bank keeps every time a user deposited money using a simple list where each entry includes the following. Amount deposited Time the money will be available for withdraw after
Interest rate At each airdrop, DecentralBank releases tokens which checks every stake the user has and gives each and every one of them the amount of interest it gets. See that DecentralBank also forbids withdrawal of stake before available after date. Tether and RWD contracts simply handle the transfers between such currencies.
